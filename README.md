## Experience
This was really fun and a perfect way to understand React. I also used the Material UI library to design my Portfolio which required a lot of time learning how to use imported components and to customize my UI. I look forward to continuing to make this portfolio stand out by adding more features.

## Technologies
- React.js 
- React DOM and React Router DOM
- Email-js npm package 
- gh-pages for deployment
- Material UI 

## Features 
I used the Email-js npm package to allow users to send me an email by filling out my contact me form. A user inputs their name, email and message and sends me an email to my personal gmail account. This package does not require a server
