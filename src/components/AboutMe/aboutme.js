                            Hi there! My name is Scotty Guenther, and I'm a full-stack developer. I grew up in Atlanta, GA where I learned the value of a collaborative atmosphere through theatre and music. Through college and my early career, I lived in Chicago where I cut my teeth in customer service. I learned the in's and out's of a business, along with how to identify and satisfy stakeholders. Now, I'm taking everything I've learned about creativity and consumer-focused business and using it to drive my career in the tech industry. I've spent six months working through Northwestern's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, and now I have experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, MySQL, and more! With a few new competencies in my arsenal, I'm excited for this next stage of my career!
